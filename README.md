<h4>One Piece is the name the world gave to all the treasure gained by the Pirate King Gol D. Roger. At least a portion of it once belonged to Joy Boy during the Void Century. The treasure is said to be of unimaginable value, and is currently located on Laugh Tale, the final island of the Grand Line. The One Piece is the driving goal of Monkey D. Luffy and his crew, as well as that of multiple other pirates, who all seek to claim the treasure in order to become the next Pirate King, following Roger's dying words at his execution.</h4>
